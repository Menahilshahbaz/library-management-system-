# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a Library Management System built with Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to manage books and members, providing features for adding, searching, issuing, and removing books, as well as tracking book status.

                                                        GUI FILE:
                                                        
This file contains the graphical user interface for the system. Its features include:
### Adding Books:

### Issuing Books to Members:

Displays the details of the books matching the query.

                                                         MAIN FILE:
                                                         
In main file the core functionality of the library system, including managing books and member records. It defines three main classes:
